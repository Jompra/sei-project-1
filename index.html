      <p>After recently joining the Starship Nimitz, you're ready for duty. 
        <br>
        <br>There's just one problem, 
        <br>whenever anyone of your rank 
        <br><strong>-- Ensign, also known as a 'redshirt' --</strong><br>
        goes on an away-mission
        <br><strong>...they usually die!</strong>
        <br>
        <br>It's best to avoid the Bridge Crew if they come looking for you!
        <br>They'll want you for an away team.
        <br>
        <br>If you're in a tight spot, you could drug the crew 
        <br>(there are some Xengarian sleeping pills onboard)
        <br>Or try the ships teleportation tunnels!</p>
